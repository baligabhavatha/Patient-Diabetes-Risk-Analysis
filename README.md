## 🌟 Overview
This tool serves as a clinical decision support system. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to estimate the probability of a patient having diabetes based on various health metrics.

### Key Features:
* **Real-time Prediction:** Adjust patient vitals via sliders and see results instantly.
* **Risk Visualization:** Uses a Plotly Gauge chart to show probability instead of a simple "Yes/No."
* **Model Explainability:** A dynamic feature importance chart shows which metrics (e.g., Glucose, BMI) are driving the prediction.
* **Data Exploration:** Interactive histograms to compare user input against the general population distribution.

**IMPORTANT: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

This application is a portfolio project intended to demonstrate machine learning implementation and web development skills. 

1. **Not Medical Advice:** The predictions generated by this model are based on a specific historical dataset and are **not** a substitute for professional medical diagnosis, advice, or treatment.
2. **Accuracy:** While the Random Forest model is trained on real clinical data, it may produce false positives or false negatives. Never use this tool to make health-related decisions.
3. **Data Privacy:** This app does not store or share any user-inputted health data. All calculations are performed in real-time within the session.

*Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for any questions regarding a medical condition.*
